# credit-history-analyze
My ML project for study-purposes. 

We have a dataset consisting of different credit histories. Target value - *bad*, that may be 
- NaN - credit was not approved for that person
- 1 - credit was approved, but person did not repay it
- 0 - credit was approved and has been repaid. 

The goal is to train the model for predicting target value.
